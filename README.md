# Showcase_Python_Skills
A showcase of what I've learned from 'Learn Intermediate Python 3' on Codecademy.

I have completed this Codecademy course and I am in the process of updating a jupyter notebook to show what I have learned. This is aimed at employers so
I can show what I have learned.

This course covers:
* Function arguments
* Namespaces and scope
* Functions deep dive
* Object-oriented programming
* Unit testing
* Iterators and generators
* Specialised collections
* Resource management

I am currently studying the 'Git and GitHub' course and afterwards I plan to continue with python with the advanced python course.
