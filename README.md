# Showcase_Python_Skills
A showcase of what I've learned from 'Learn Intermediate Python 3' and 'Learn Advanced Python 3' on Codecademy.

I have completed this Codecademy course and I am in the process of updating a jupyter notebook to show what I have learned. This is aimed at employers so
I can show what I have learned.

This intermediate course covers:
* Function arguments
* Namespaces and scope

* Object-oriented programming
* Unit testing
* Iterators and generators
* Specialised collections
* Resource management

and the advanced course covers:
